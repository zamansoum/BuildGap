**WickerScripts - collection of scripts I created to help me with some tasks**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Scripts:**

---
**pkgdownload** - For downloading apt packages with corresponding dependencies. After downloading, all files are bundled together in a tarball. You can find it [here](https://github.com/wickerlabs/WickerScripts/blob/master/Shell/pkgdownload).

> **Installation:**

> Being in the same directory (working directory) as the script, run the command:

> :~# **sudo cp {script_name} /usr/local/bin**

> Replace {script_name} with the specific script file. This will make it usable anywhere in the shell environment.

> *Note: You may have to enter your UNIX password.*
